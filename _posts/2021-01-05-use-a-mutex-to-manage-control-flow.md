title: Use a Mutex to manage control flow

_As a primer for this post I should mention that the Mutex type I describe here is not related to thread locks/mutexes and I'm not suggesting reusing/abusing any existing types like `NSLock` in a different context. I mean only that we can reuse the **concept** of a Mutex for more simply managing control flow. Ok, now on to the post..._

Happy New Year! I hope this finds you all settling back into work, a couple of pounds heavier, and all the more jolly for it after a nice 2020 holiday season. Further, I hope you're all rested and ready to turn your minds back toward coding (and control flow in particular...)

A control-flow technique which many of you are likely familiar with goes something like this:

``` swift
class MyViewController: UIViewController {
    private var isLoading: Bool = false

    func load() {
        guard !isLoading else { return }

        isLoading = true

        model
            .fetch()
            .handleEvents(receiveCompletion: { [weak self] _ in
                self?.isLoading = false
            }
        ...
    }
}
```

This methodologyâ€”one I've used many timesâ€”is plenty effective, but has always felt a bit cumbersome and potentially error prone as there are several areas where you need to toggle the `isLoading` boolean and thusly there are several opportunities to forget to do so. I've long been considering a `propertyWrapper` to encapsulate and streamline this logic, but I struggled to come up with naming and ergonomics which felt like an improvement over the existing solution.

After a bit of brainstorming, I realized this technique relates quite closely to a `mutex`. Effectively, we could consider that we are trying to claim/lock the mutex for `isLoading`, returning true if we were successfully able to acquire the mutex. If we were successful, the function body continues executionâ€”though if we were unsuccessful (because we are in the midst of a loading operation), the function would return early. After toying around with this a bit, I decided there wasn't a need for a propertyWrapper and that a simple struct should suffice.

Here is a simple example of such a type in action:

``` swift
class MyViewController: UIViewController {
    private var loadingMutex = Mutex()

    func load() {
        guard loadingMutex.claim() else { return }

        model
            .fetch()
            .handleEvents(receiveCompletion: { [weak self] _ in
                self?.loadingMutex.release()
            })
        ...
    }
}
```

We've now reduced the need for an extra toggling of the `isLoading` boolean as this has been handled by the `Mutex` type during the `claim()` call. One less chance for errors. ðŸŽ‰

Of course this is not without its tradeoffs. In this case there may be a slight bit of cognitive overhead understanding the `Mutex` type as well as the intention behind this particular instance. However, I feel the type is simple enough where a developer should be able to quickly understand it in its entiretyâ€”and with proper naming of the mutex property, the purpose of this instance should remain very straightforward.

As we dive into the declaration of the struct behind this, we can see it is incredibly simple, yet extensible enough to allow for managing various portions of "stateful" control flow.

``` swift
public struct Mutex<Value> {
    private var value: Value
}

extension Mutex where Value == Bool {
    init() {
        self.value = true
    }

    /// Attempts to acquire the mutex & returns a boolean indicating whether the acquisition was successful.
    @discardableResult
    public mutating func claim() -> Bool {
        defer { value = false }
        return value
    }

    public mutating func release() {
        self.value = true
    }
}
```

The boolean extension alone covers off on the majority of simple casesâ€”like the example aboveâ€”however we can easily add another extension to enable this to work for a much more complex bit of state management.

``` swift
extension Mutex where Value: OptionSet {
    public init() {
        self.value = []
    }

    @discardableResult
    public mutating func claim(for option: Value.Element) -> Bool {
        defer { value.insert(option) }
        return !value.contains(option)
    }

    public func unless(_ option: Value.Element) -> Bool {
        !value.contains(option)
    }

    public mutating func release(for option: Value.Element) {
        self.value.remove(option)
    }
}
```

Putting this to use, if we imagine a `State` OptionSet we can see where using a Mutex here may really shine:

``` swift
struct State: OptionSet {
    var rawValue: Int

    static let loading: Self = .init(rawValue: 1 << 0)
    static let loaded: Self = .init(rawValue: 1 << 1)
}

class MyViewController: UIViewController {
    private var stateMutex = Mutex<State>()

    func load() {
        guard stateMutex.claim(for: .loading), stateMutex.unless(.loaded) else { return }

        model
            .fetch()
            .handleEvents(receiveCompletion: { [weak self] _ in
                self?.loadingMutex.release(for: .loading)
                self?.loadedMutex.claim(for: .loaded)
            })
        ...
    }
}
```

This will prevent further loads if the `stateMutex` indicates that it is either currently loading or has already been loaded. Pretty cool!

Alright, I'll wrap it up here and leave it to you to see how else you can leverage this simple Mutex type. I hope you find this idea useful and that it inspires you to clean up your codebase just a little bit so you can start 2021 off on the right foot.

Happy coding!
