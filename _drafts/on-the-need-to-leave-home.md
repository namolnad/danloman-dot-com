title: On the need to leave home to find success
---

What is it about leaving the small town of your childhood and the resulting self gratification you feel as you search for a sense of accomplishment?

I’ve never given it much thought, but I’m aware of the unspoken feelings I have around individuals who never left my hometown. There are, of course, individuals who I know actively chose to stay home to pursue their version of success or to maintain their communal roots. These individuals, however, I have found myself considering as the exceptions. The people who simply stay, with no purpose or reason, I — shameful as it feels to admit — think of as never having lived, never having explored, never having succeeded. Perhaps this hints at the meaning behind the feeling. Is it simply the intentionality behind their choices? Perhaps.

I wonder as well if this is unique to those from small towns. Those who, as we’ve oft seen portrayed in Hollywood films, dream of traveling to the big city to “be a star” or to “conquer the world” always come from a small town and are looking for more.

Does this sentiment apply equally to those from metropolitan upbringings? I imagine city-dwellers and country-bumpkins all experience this to some degree, but I suspect it is highly asymmetrical in favor —  leaning much further in the direction of rural folk feeling this longing for change.
